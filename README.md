# DevonThink CSS

Provides a very simple, clean CSS for DevonThink rendering of Markdown
documents.

## To use

In DevonThink preferences, under the *Media* tab, provide the path to
devonthink.css in the *Style Sheet* field.

## To test

Use the render.sh script to test. This depends on pandoc and fswatch. It watches
sample.md for changes and generates sample.html for testing in a browser.
